# TrafficIQ-Using-Prolog

## Project Briefing:  

The Smart City Initiative aims to develop “TrafficIQ,” an AI-equipped cloud-based traffic management system that is designed to optimize urban traffic flow and reduce congestion. TrafficIQ will be integrated within the city’s infrastructure to enhance transport efficiency and sustainability.  
Our team is responsible for developing the AI prediction and inference engine of TrafficIQ. Project scoping interviews with Smart City Initiative stakeholders has revealed the need for a modular system design consisting of two critical sub-systems: 

**1. Traffic Prediction sub-system:** To perform predictive modelling of traffic flow using neural networks or other relevant machine learning algorithms. 

**2. Logical Inference sub-system:** To utilize the neural network predictions and allow human users to ask logical queries regarding traffic management (e.g., “What will happen to traffic volumes on Street A if Street B is closed due to roadworks from 7-9 am on a Monday morning?”). 

These sub-systems are combined to form the AI Prediction and Inference Engine of TrafficIQ, enabling comprehensive decision-making for advanced urban traffic management. 

## Logical Inference Sub-system. 

A Logical Inference System must be developed that utilises the traffic volume predictions from the machine learning model. The steps of involved in developing this Logical Inference Sub-system must involve:

a) Creating a Prolog Knowledge Base including defining predicates and facts as listed below to represent different traffic conditions based on the machine learning model traffic volume predictions.
